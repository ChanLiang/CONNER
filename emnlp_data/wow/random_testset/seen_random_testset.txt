Fishing tackle	I like fishing. When I fish I use fishing tackle. [SEP] Fishing is fun, been a while since i last went. [SEP] My fishing tackle consists mostly of hooks and sinkers. [SEP] yep, it also depends a lot on the bait. [SEP] Have you ever been fly fishing? [SEP] No, seems like a weird and difficult concept. [SEP] No, you are just using an artificial fly to catch the fish. [SEP] yea but the angle and concept of it makes it harder than normal fishing.

[SEP] oh, i think i've heard about it. do you know why the tower of Pisa is leaning? .	The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight.	Yep.

[SEP] If well-planned and fortified to balance their deficiencies, vegetarian and vegan diets can become nutritionally adequate . [SEP] Exactly.

I think the hard walls in the bathroom create an atmosphere that anyone's voice sounds good. . [SEP] Makes sense I know I sound like a pro in the bathroom, not so much singing in the car lol.	Small dimensions and hard surfaces of a typical bathroom produce various kinds of standing waves, reverberation and echoes, giving the voice "fullness and depth."

[SEP] I noticed that too, not to mention that they are starting to release some of their movies in select theaters I believe. Blockbuster must still have regrets.	Competition from the Netflix mail-order service, Redbox automated kiosks, and video on demand services were major factors in Blockbuster's eventual demise.	Yeah, with Netflix, Redbox kiosks etc. Blockbuster didn't stand a chance.

It is called "closed-loop cruise" when that happens . [SEP] Well they cost quite a hefty sum to ride. [SEP] And does it worth it especially when it is a "nowhere voyages"  where the ship makes 2–3 night round trips without any ports of call. [SEP] Oh wow really? Thats quite interesting.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker created it. [SEP] It is really funny. There are some parts not appropriate for children though.	Much like "The Simpsons", "South Park" uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience.	That's very true. It does have profanity and there is a dark humor to it, so usually for mature audiences.

[SEP] Do you use hooks made of wood or metal when you crochet? [SEP] I prefer metal because wood breaks.	It is basically a round shaft pointed on one end, with a lateral groove behind it.	That makes sense.  Is the shaft easier to work with on a metal one?

[SEP] Some roses are grown for hedging or ground cover.  Maybe that is what your "farm roses" are! [SEP] Probably so! They were actually trying to take over my porch, so I could see how they could be good hedging. .

Adoption	Have you ever known anyone who has been adopted? I just recently met a girl who was and I would have never been able to tell. [SEP] I actually know several families who have adopted children. It's really awesome to see how a permanent home benefits the children. [SEP] Definitely! I know that she wasn't able to find a permanent home up until Senior year in high school and that must be rough for kids to go through. [SEP] I can imagine. What's interesting is that while most kids are adopted by couples, an individual can adopt under certain circumstances and if the child is at least 14 years younger. [SEP] That's interesting, I've never known that. It's also true that once they turn 18, they are no longer allowed in the program, right? [SEP] A girl I was friends with growing up was adopted even after she was 18. She wasn't in the system. but the family that adopted her did it more for the legal reasons because they wanted her to be their daughter officially. [SEP] Oh okay, so theres ways that it can happen. I just heard that once they turn 18, it gets tough and thats why most kids in the program dont finish high school. Thats interesting.	Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents.	I would say that's probably true for those in the foster care system. Adoption tends to bring more stability though since the child will be there permanently.

[SEP] I have heard that they can also live in a number of different climates. [SEP] Yes, lizards have over 6,000 species and live in all continents except Antarctica. [SEP] I wonder if one day we will ever discover a lizard on Antarctica. [SEP] It's always possible, lizards have gone through many adaptations including camouflage and venom production, so maybe they will adapt to the cold too. [SEP] I would love to have my own lizard from the arctic.	The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters for chameleons such as "Brookesia micra" and geckos such as "Sphaerodactylus ariasae" to nearly in the case of the largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo dragon.	If you want a truly impressive lizard, the komodo dragon is largest living lizard.

That would scare me and so would the legless ones.
Chocolate	Chocolate is a delicious sweet, and made from "Theobroma cacao' seeds. They roast, then ground it first. [SEP] That sounds excellent. Where did it originate? [SEP] The earliest in can be found is Mexico (Olmecs), and beverages from back in 1900 BCE! [SEP] That's so long ago! Did they eat is like we do now? [SEP] Not quite, they would use in beverages, and it was called 'xocolatl', which means bitter water. So, I imagine no sweetness! [SEP] The way these ingredients have developed over time is fascinating.	The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.	It is, since the cacoa tree seeds have a very bitter taste, it was fermented so the flavor would come out.

[SEP] Sometimes you can cook it in sauce too such as  in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers and i know by that you will not set your smoke detector on . [SEP] Oh thats good to know, maybe I will try that next time.  I usually use sauces on it after its finished cooking.

I don't have to worry about them being under-cooked! .
