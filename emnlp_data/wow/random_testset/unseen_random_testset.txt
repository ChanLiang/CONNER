Common sense does come around sometimes. [SEP] Yes, and those principles are still used today. It's like 80% diet and 20% exercise.	Later, bodybuilder Earle Liederman advocated the use of "beef juice" or "beef extract" (basically, consomme) as a way to enhance muscle recovery.

Bowling	I love bowling, In fact I do it every week, How about you? . [SEP] I enjoy bowling, but I don't go all that often.

[SEP] I only have used the bowling balls provided at the bowling alley. Most of the time I use the 12lb ball. Most of the time I hold the ball in the palm of my hand when I throw it. [SEP] I usually use a lighter ball but I hear using a heavier one has a higher accuracy. Is that true? . [SEP] The accuracy of the bowling ball really boils down to practice and using the same ball over and over again. . [SEP] Ah yes thats what I thought. Do you know how a person can go pro? is it difficult, I am assuming you need to hold a very high score to be eligible. .	It is one of the major forms of throwing sports.	You would have to start out playing in local leagues and then move your way up. You would have to do very well, because it is one of the major throwing sports and is very competitive. .

[SEP] Cheerleaders have to be pretty good athletes themselves. Many of them do all kinds of stunts! [SEP] Yes the activities can be chanting of  slogans to intense physical activity. [SEP] There are all sorts of national competitions for cheerleading as well. It has really changed a lot since I was a cheerleader years ago! [SEP] oh yea?, well when such events occur, then there need to be cheerleaders to  to motivate sports teams, entertain the audience. . [SEP] That's true! Cheerleading is very popular here in the US. Thousands of kids participate, mostly girls but some boys too. .	Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains predominantly in America, with an estimated 1.5 million participants in all-star cheerleading.	That is because cheerleading is actually a USA thing as it started there.
Harry Potter	Do you like Harry Potter? I have to admit I have not read any books or seen any of the movies.	Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling.	I have seen a couple of the movies when I was younger, im not a huge fan though! Everyone seems to love the series, i know it was produced by J.K Rowling.
Nickelback	Did you ever get into nickelback? I never minded them, but they seem very hated for some reason. [SEP] Never really got into them but they are a Canadian rock band. They formed around 1995. . [SEP] Oh, I did not know they were around that long, or even from canada. [SEP] Nickleback is on of the most successful bands from Canada.

Nickelback also have four albums on the Billboard top albums of the decade. They are also listed as number 7 on the Billboard top artist of the decade.
Split (bowling)	I am a professional bowler, I love the sport. [SEP] That is very impressive! I love to bowl but I am terrible. Bowling is a sport where a players rolls a ball towards a target and I was lucky to known down half of them! lol. [SEP] In bowling a perfect score is 300, and it's almost impossible to do. [SEP] Wow! To achieve a score of 300 it means that you have 12 strikes in a row. Have you ever achieved this score? [SEP] Only a couple of times.  What's even hard is making a 7-10 split.	One of the most infamous of splits is the 7–10 split, often called "goal posts" or "bedposts", where the bowler is left with the leftmost and the rightmost pin in the back row (the "number 7" and "number 10") to knock down with a single ball to achieve a spare.

Beef skeletal muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.).	Beef is also a main source for steaks like sirlon and rib eye etc.
Broken heart	I suffer from a broken heart. [SEP] Did you go through a breakup? Broken heart is often a metaphor used for an intense emotional pain. [SEP] Yeah we where together for 4 years. [SEP] Im sorry to hear that.  Emotion pain if severe enough can cause actual physical damage to the heart. [SEP] Yeah it is not any fun. [SEP] Social attachment and the pain system encourage people to keep close contact with people when they lose relationships. [SEP] No one will ever get used to it but we will all experince it.	The concept is believed to be universal, with many cultures using the same words to describe both physical pain and the feelings associated with relationship loss.	I hope you get through it.  Many cultures experience the same things and describe it the same way and having the same feelings.

[SEP] For me Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are, so you have to find your own ways to motivate yourself. [SEP] Hmm, okay I see what you mean. What do you do to stay motivated when you have to do a rather mundane task? . [SEP] Motivation as a desire to perform an action that you rather not, so you need to find the reason why, and hopefully change your mind :D. [SEP] Ahh I see, so if I find a suitable reason why I should do a task I will find motivation easier. That sounds good to me. :).	The "wanting behavior" associated with a rewarding stimulus can be increased by microinjections of dopamine and dopaminergic drugs in the dorsorostral nucleus accumbens and posterior ventral palladium.

[SEP] Do you read any of his books? [SEP] I never have but I heard his books have been translated into 42 languages, I think he's a popular author. [SEP] Wow, that's a lot of languages to translate a book in. I believe his books are suspenseful and involve law related stories since his background is a lawyer. [SEP] Oh that's really cool, I heard he was writing thrillers as well. It amazes me how people from different backgrounds write books. Grisham was a lawyer, take Benjamin Spock for example, he was a pediatrician who was writing books too. [SEP] If you have a strong background in something, I think its great to write books to educate or entertain the population. I have always wanted to write books and have even started writing a couple.	The book's premise to mothers is that "you know more than you think you do."	Yeah , Spock wrote "you know more than you think you do". So I think anyone can begin writing, using what they're best at and own knowledge.
American football	I've always been in love with American football, since a kid. It's a fairly simple game, a team sport, 11 players on each side, with goalposts at the end of the 100-yard field. Easy to get into! [SEP] I've never seen a game, but my husband loves football! I don't know much about the sport! How do you score points?	Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.	The offense scores it, by either running or passing the ball, and they have four chances to advance it 10 yards, or they lose control. The points come mostly by moving the ball into the other team's end-zone, or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts!

[SEP] Sounds like a lot of fun! Is it easy to use the application or website? [SEP] It is easy to use. I also find lots of U2 pop album music there. . [SEP] Wow, now that's what I'd be interested in using it for, I love my music! [SEP] Do you ever listen to the British band Bow Wow Wow? [SEP] Oh my God, now you're talking about the music that I grew-up listening to!	Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on May 16, 1966.	YEs. We agree.

I drew blood the other day and the guy I was talking with was a former paramedic. I'm actually like 2.5 years from completing a biological science degree, so I'm definitely interested in medical science stuff.	A paramedic is a healthcare professional, predominantly in the pre-hospital and out-of-hospital environment, and working mainly as part of emergency medical services (EMS), such as on an ambulance.

Genghis Khan	I'm taking a course on Genghis Khan. Heard about him? He was the founder of the Mongol Empire. [SEP] He was a really interesting guy, very violent though haha. [SEP] I know!

Ireland	I have always wanted to visit Ireland. I wonder what it is like. [SEP] Ireland is comprised of relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. [SEP] I always see so much greenery and land when I see pictures of it. [SEP] Oh yes, Ireland has lush vegetation which is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. [SEP] I think it is so magical. I wonder if they really have elves. [SEP] I'm not sure, but maybe fairies are one of the twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland. [SEP] Lol. I have such an active imagination that I would say something so ridiculous. I wonder what mammals they do have. [SEP] Well, Ireland has humans. In fact the the population of humans in Ireland was about 6.6 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. [SEP] How interesting!

[SEP] Wow, that must be an exciting industry! Is it a fulfilling career? [SEP] It really is. Although the scope of what you do can vary widely across the globe, the paraprofession in the US just recently came around in the 1970s, which most people don't know. [SEP] I did not know that! What all does your daily job entail? [SEP] It varies widely. But it's a role that finds itself closely related to other healthcare positions, especially EMS roles, where you have a higher grade role, which is to say you'll be granted both more responsibility and autonomy. [SEP] Oh wow, that is impressive. Do you plan on doing this for the rest of your career? [SEP] We will see. I may be moving, so it could change things, as there are different models of care for EMS providers given the area they're in, and those different models can influence the scope of practice they can do in an area. [SEP] That is understandable. That seems like a career that has job opportunities anywhere, though.	no_passages_used	It's definitely a noble profession, as we strive to transport patients with illnesses and injuries to prevent the patients from transporting themselves and causing further harm. We aim to give them the best acute medical care!
Elvis Presley	Do you think Elvis Presley is truly still the king after all this time? [SEP] I think he is still one of the most significant cultural icons today. No doubt about it. [SEP] Personally I always preferred Johnny Cash over Elvis but you cannot deny that he had the moves. [SEP] I mean he was a pioneer of uptempo rockabilly music. It don't get much better than that. [SEP] What is your favorite song by Elvis? [SEP] My favorite was his first single called "Heartbreak Hotel". [SEP] Nice, I always get into Hounddog when I hear it.	His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience.	That was a great song. You have to admire him for taking African American music global.

[SEP] Irish Wolfhounds are up there, but they don't range as much in colors or coat length like chihuahuas do. [SEP] I didn't know Chihuahuas had any breeds other than short haired!	The Chihuahua's history is convoluted, and there are many theories surrounding the origin of the breed.	Neither did I! I also never knew how convoluted the history of them was.

Nickelback	What do you think about the band nickelback? [SEP] Nickelback is a Canadian rock band formed in 1995 that is not very good. [SEP] oh so you are not a fan? I think the music is ok.  I only mentioned them because they have sentimental value to me as I met my wife at their concert.  I was given free tickets in work and decided to go and accidently met the woman I later fell in love with. [SEP] Rock music of Canada is a wide and diverse part of the general music of Canada. [SEP] Im sure it is.  You say your not a fan but is there any songs you like of theirs? Even rockstar?	Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian groups, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide and ranking as the eleventh best-selling music act, and the second best-selling foreign act in the U.S. of the 2000s, behind The Beatles.	Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian groups, and I don't know why.

Ive seen people with stubby short skis and no poles before. The first skier who used two poles was back in 1741.
