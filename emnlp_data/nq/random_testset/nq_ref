In vertebrates , the gallbladder is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine . In humans , the pear - shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver , although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species . It receives and stores bile , produced by the liver , via the common hepatic duct , and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum , where the bile helps in the digestion of fats .

Originally introduced as a classical tax system , in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies ' shareholders were also liable to income tax on the dividends that they received , the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a dividend imputation system in 1973 , under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend . The classical system was reintroduced in 1999 , with the abolition of advance corporation tax and of repayable dividend tax credits . Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three . Tax competition between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28 % in 2008 - 2010 to a flat rate of 20 % as of April 2015 .

Doctor Poison appears in the DC Extended Universe film Wonder Woman ( 2017 ) , portrayed by Elena Anaya . In this adaptation , her identity is Isabel Maru , a Spanish chemist recruited by General Erich Ludendorff to create chemical weapons for the German army . Due to facial disfigurement , she wears a ceramic mask over the left side of her face . It marks the character 's first live action appearance , although the setting is World War I rather than the World War II setting of the comic books . When Steve Trevor steals a book of Doctor Maru 's notes on her new chemical weapons that would render the gas masks useless against them , he crash - lands on Themyscira during his escape , which alerts Diana to the current war . She initially believes that Ares is directly responsible for the war , but later learns that all he did was provide a few ideas for the weapons to the likes of Maru while the decision to use the weapons was still the choice of the humans themselves . Ares attempts to sway Diana to his point of view by offering her a chance to kill Maru for her sins and part in the war , but Diana rejects his offer upon realizing of Trevor 's sacrifice that inspires her to recognize that she must accept humanity for its flaws rather than condemn it for not being perfect . This leads Diana to spare Maru out of mercy , who then flees .
A regulatory site ( also known as an `` allosteric site '' ) is a site on an allosteric protein to which a modulator molecule ( or allosteric regulator ) binds . This ligand - binding site on a receptor or enzyme is distinct from the active site . Allosteric modulators alter enzyme activity by binding to the regulatory site . Some allosteric regulators activate enzymes , while others inhibit them . The working hypothesis is that when allosteric regulators bind to the regulatory site , the protein undergoes conformational changes which changes the enzyme 's activity .

The trio tries to break the UK speed record for amphibious vehicles by building one of their own .

They are shown to be slower round the Area 27 circuit than a BMW M3 , not practical enough to carry Canadian Newfoundland dogs , and slower round a barrel course than a horse : concluding that SUVs are pointless . Despite this , executive producer Andy Wilman informs via text that they will race their SUVs whilst each towing a boat up a mountain . May abandons his Velar for his boat , which sinks , causing him to lose the race . Because Clarkson 's Stelvio has no tow bar he cheats and exchanges it for a Ford F150 Raptor , ultimately arriving first with the presenters concluding that the Raptor was better than all the SUVs being tested . On Conversation Street the presenters talk about new SUVs and vans . Clarkson reviews the Tesla Model X at the Eboladrome and on the road , accompanied by some lawyers , ostensibly to avoid Tesla pursuing any legal action , following the previous Tesla v.

To do this , each of them attempt to find the best transport solution : May buys a Mercedes - Benz Estate and modifies it by fitting a Perspex tank filled with sea water in which to keep the fish alive ; Clarkson buys a Nissan Hardbody truck which he fits with a generator and an ice machine in an attempt to keep the fish frozen and Hammond buys a TVS Star motorcycle and devises a rack which he fits to the bike 's rear , inspired by a local method of drying and salting the fish to preserve them . After unsuccessfully trying to catch fish using local methods , they buy fish at a local market . Early in the journey , Clarkson 's truck crashes into May 's car upon rescuing it , damaging its radiator grille . Deeper into rural Mozambique , May constantly soaks himself with sea water from his ill - fitted tank and , due to his damaged radiator grille , suffers multiple breakdowns due to water intrusion . Hammond loses a large number of his fish on the bumpy roads , constantly gets stuck in thick mud and endlessly falls from his motorbike . Clarkson suffers very few issues except when his ice machine breaks , causing him to make small adjustments to his truck in order to smoke the fish with his exhaust . Upon May 's car breaking down in the middle of a lake , despite Hammond and Clarkson crossing successfully , Clarkson cuts off the front end of the Mercedes and tows what remains of the rear portion using his truck - much to May 's dismay and annoyance . Eventually , the three reach Bingo with May 's fish dead , Clarkson 's fish ruined and Hammond having almost no fish left . As a result , they sell no fish and leave Bingo in a helicopter `` like all charitable celebrities '' .

Jack McCoy brings 24 years of experience with him as he is appointed executive assistant district attorney by Adam Schiff ( Steven Hill ) in the season - five premiere episode `` Second Opinion '' . He quickly establishes himself as a more unconventional , ruthless litigator than his predecessor , Ben Stone ( Michael Moriarty ) . He often bends -- and sometimes breaks -- trial rules to get convictions , finds tenuous rationales for charging defendants with crimes when the original charges fail to stick , and charges innocent people to frighten them into testifying against others . McCoy is found in contempt of court 80 times for such behavior , and his tactics occasionally incur negative publicity for the DA 's office . His underlying motivation , however , is not , he maintains , corruption , but a sincere desire to see justice done . To that end , McCoy has gone after defendants accused of perverting the justice system to arrange wrongful convictions with just as much determination as his more mundane cases . Such aggressive actions in the courts have earned him the nickname `` Hang ' em High McCoy '' . He has subsequently developed a reputation with both colleagues and rival attorneys , once being referred to as `` the top of the legal food chain '' by a rival attorney during a trial .

On 1 September 1939 , Germany invaded Poland . Two days later , on 3 September , after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored , Britain and France declared war on Germany .

Gavin Shipman ( Mathew Horne ) - Gavin is 28 when the series starts . He is an only child , and when the series starts he still lives with his loving mother and father in Billericay , Essex . He gets on well with his parents . He works for a company called ICB and spends his spare time with his best friend Smithy ( James Corden ) along with his other friends Gary & Simon , Dirtbox , Fingers , Budgie , Swede , Chinese Alan and Jesus . He is a big fan of Tottenham Hotspur ( as is Mathew Horne ) and is often seen wearing his Spurs shirt . In the course of his job , he had to deal with a company called Bedmores , based in Barry . The Bedmores representative he had to correspond with was a woman called Stacey West ( Joanna Page ) . Gavin and Stacey had to speak regularly because of their jobs , and they found they got on very well . After months and months of talking and flirting , they agreed to meet up in London . They agreed that Gavin would bring his best friend Smithy with him , and Stacey would bring her best friend Nessa ( Ruth Jones ) with her . They met up and went clubbing . They had a great time , and got on very well . They went back to Stacey 's hotel room and had sex . The next day , Stacey had to go back to Barry , but she and Gavin promised to keep ringing each other and that this would not be the end of their relationship . While Stacey and Nessa boarded the coach back to Barry , Gavin and Smithy got a cab back to Billericay . Without waiting for Smithy , Gavin jumped in his car and drove all the way to Barry , and met Stacey when her coach pulled into the station , to her surprise . He and Stacey told each other they loved each other for the first time . Within 9 weeks , they had got engaged and married . Despite a few initial problems regarding Stacey being homesick , their relationship was successful , and Stacey became eventually pregnant . Gavin , and his father Mick ( Larry Lamb ) , often play the `` straight men '' in the series . Much of the comedy comes from the actions of those around them ( especially his mother Pam ( Alison Steadman ) and Smithy ) . It is clear that Gavin loves his friends and family very much . Despite the fact that his mother Pam often overreacts and acts without thinking , Gavin still loves her , despite being occasionally exasperated by her . His best friend Smithy is also prone to overreact , but Gavin sticks with him and loves him like a little brother . Gavin 's main personality flaw is that he is slightly spoiled , possibly due to being an only child , and reacts with irritation when he does n't get his way . He is also not particularly sensitive - he sometimes fails to understand the much more emotional Smithy and Stacey , and this occasionally puts strain on his relationship with both of them - when Stacey , who is very attached to her hometown of Barry , gets depressed and homesick upon moving to Billericay after she and Gavin marry , Gavin is more confused than concerned about this , and his responses are lacking in sensitivity about the matter . This can also be seen in the fact that Gavin is less talkative and expressive than Stacey is - while at dinner with their families after their honeymoon , Stacey is excited and full of conversation , while Gavin simply sits and listens to her . Despite all of this , Gavin loves Stacey enormously , and is very affectionate towards her , and his greatest display of love for her is when he decides to move to Barry with her despite having expressed a dislike of it previously , and he manages to get himself a new job in Wales so he can reside there . There , his boss Huw Davies and colleague Owain Hughes ( Steven Meo ) act very similar to Stacey 's uncle , Bryn ( Rob Brydon ) , talking incessantly and being over-friendly , personality traits that bewilder Gavin . Gavin is more reserved and less willing to discuss his private life than his wife . He finds it odd that Stacey is so eager and ready to spill information about their private life to Nessa , Bryn , her mother Gwen ( Melanie Walters ) and her brother Jason ( Robert Wilfort ) . When Gavin is applying for a job in Cardiff , the only people who know are Stacey and Mick . When he and Stacey announce it to the rest of the characters , Gwen announces that she knew as well , because Stacey told her . Gavin is annoyed that Stacey told Gwen , and by the fact that Stacey did not tell him she had told Gwen . He does n't understand why Stacey always has to be so close to her family . It is n't that he is distant from his family , he just does n't depend on his as much as Stacey does hers . In Series 3 , he agrees with Stacey to try to have a baby , only to discover she stopped taking the pill a year ago . Although he is very angry about Stacey not telling him the truth , he becomes much more depressed when he learns that he has fertility problems . However , he eventually comes round , and has a serious discussion with Stacey about the problem , deciding they will carry on trying to conceive for a few months , and if that does n't work , they should start looking at alternatives . However , in the final episode , Stacey discovers she pregnant , and Gavin is completely as overjoyed .

The French and Indian War ( 1754 -- 63 ) comprised the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years ' War of 1756 -- 63 . It pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France . Both sides were supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France , as well as by American Indian allies . At the start of the war , the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers , compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies . The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict .

A diastema ( plural diastemata ) is a space or gap between two teeth . Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature , most commonly between the incisors and molars . Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well . Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth . If the labial frenulum ( lip tissue ) pulls , it can also push the teeth apart and cause a diastema between the center of the two front teeth .
A metal staircase reaches the main deck level after 1,776 steps , and the SkyPod 100 m ( 328 ft ) above after 2,579 steps ; it is the tallest metal staircase on Earth . These stairs are intended for emergency use only and are not open to the public , except for two times per year for charity stair - climb events . The average climber takes approximately 30 minutes to climb to the base of the radome , but the fastest climb on record is 7 minutes and 52 seconds in 1989 by Brendan Keenoy , an Ontario Provincial Police officer . In 2002 , Canadian Olympian and Paralympic champion Jeff Adams climbed the stairs of the tower in a specially designed wheelchair . The stairs were originally on one of the three sides of the tower ( facing north ) , with a glass view , but these were later replaced with the third elevator pair and the stairs were moved to the inside of the core . Top climbs on the new , windowless stairwell used since around 2003 have generally been over ten minutes .

The water cycle , also known as the hydrological cycle or the hydrologic cycle , describes the continuous movement of water on , above and below the surface of the Earth . The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice , fresh water , saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables . The water moves from one reservoir to another , such as from river to ocean , or from the ocean to the atmosphere , by the physical processes of evaporation , condensation , precipitation , infiltration , surface runoff , and subsurface flow .

The structure of the Talmud follows that of the Mishnah , in which six orders ( sedarim ; singular : seder ) of general subject matter are divided into 60 or 63 tractates ( masekhtot ; singular : masekhet ) of more focused subject compilations , though not all tractates have Gemara . Each tractate is divided into chapters ( perakim ; singular : perek ) , 517 in total , that are both numbered according to the Hebrew alphabet and given names , usually using the first one or two words in the first mishnah . A perek may continue over several ( up to tens of ) pages . Each perek will contain several mishnayot with their accompanying exchanges that form the `` building - blocks '' of the Gemara ; the name for a passage of gemara is a sugya ( סוגיא ‎ ; plural sugyot ) . A sugya , including baraita or tosefta , will typically comprise a detailed proof - based elaboration of a Mishnaic statement , whether halakhic or aggadic . A sugya may , and often does , range widely off the subject of the mishnah . The sugya is not punctuated in the conventional sense used in the English language , but by using specific expressions that help to divide the sugya into components , usually including a statement , a question on the statement , an answer , a proof for the answer or a refutation of the answer with its own proof .

The Tower of London , officially Her Majesty 's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London , is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London . It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite . The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ) , although that was not its primary purpose . A grand palace early in its history , it served as a royal residence . As a whole , the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion , mainly under Kings Richard I , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site .

The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop 's `` earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience ... since the late 1950s , however , pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus ( ic ) , usually in the form of songs , performed by such artists as the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , ABBA , etc '' . Grove Music Online also states that `` ... in the early 1960s , ( the term ) ' pop music ' competed terminologically with beat music ( in England ) , while in the USA its coverage overlapped ( as it still does ) with that of ' rock and roll ' '' .

Santa Claus , also known as Saint Nicholas , Kris Kringle , Father Christmas , or simply Santa , is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well - behaved ( `` good '' or `` nice '' ) children on Christmas Eve ( 24 December ) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day ( 25 December ) . The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas ( a fourth - century Greek bishop and gift - giver of Myra ) , the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas ( himself also based on Saint Nicholas ) . Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic god Wodan , who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt , a ghostly procession through the sky .
In 1932 an outbreak of whooping cough hit Atlanta , Georgia , prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease . Over the next six years her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company , she developed the first pertussis vaccine . In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering , Loney Gordon , and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole - cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine . To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component , Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins ( HAs : filamentous strep throat and leukocytosis - promoting - factor HA ) , which are secreted by B. pertussis . Sato 's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981 . Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine .

Season Title Episodes Director Characters Season premiere `` Total Drama Island '' 28 Todd Kauffman / Mark Thornton 22 July 8 , 2007 ( 2007 - 07 - 08 ) Total Drama Island is the first season of the series . It first premiered on Canada on July 8 , 2007 and June 5 , 2008 on the United States . This season takes place at Camp Wawanakwa , a fictional island located somewhere in Muskoka , Ontario where the season is based on a summer camp theme ( although a contestant is eliminated at the end of every episode ) . Like the whole series , this season is a competition to see which of the twenty - two contestants will survive and last the longest . This is because the contestants are brutally tortured along the way through the intense challenges they are given . Challenges are sometimes based on other reality shows like Fear Factor and Survivor . All of this is so that the winner of the season ( the one to last the longest on the island and not get eliminated ) , will win a small fortune of C $ 100,000 and cheesy fame . Eliminated contestants are sent packing toward the Dock of Shame and must ride the Boat of Losers off the island . `` Total Drama Action '' 27 Todd Kauffman / Mark Thornton 15 January 11 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 11 ) Total Drama Action is the second season of the series .

However , some characters from the original cast still have cameo appearances throughout the season .

The history of chocolate in Spain is part of the culinary history of Spain as understood since the 16th century , when the colonization of the Americas began and the cocoa plant was discovered in regions of Mesoamerica , until the present . After the conquest of Mexico , cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva España to the Spanish coast . The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s . However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz , opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain , and later from other European countries .
A period in the periodic table is one of the horizontal rows , all of those elements have the same number of electron shells . Going across a period , each element has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor . Arranged this way , groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties , reflecting the periodic law . For example , the alkali metals lie in the first column ( group 1 ) and share similar properties , such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble - gas electronic configuration . As of 2016 a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed .

At around 18 to 19 days after fertilisation , the heart begins to form . This early development is critical for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development . The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22 . The heart begins to develop near the head of the embryo in the cardiogenic area . Following cell signalling , two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic region As these form , a lumen develops within them , at which point , they are referred to as endocardial tubes . At the same time that the tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed . The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube , the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions . From head to tail , these are the truncus arteriosus , bulbus cordis , primitive ventricle , primitive atrium , and the sinus venosus . Initially , all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus , and contractions propel the blood from tail to head , or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus . The truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery ; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle ; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle ; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages , and the sinus venous will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium , the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus .

The Dodgers -- Yankees rivalry is a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees . The Dodgers are a member club of the National League ( NL ) West division , and the Yankees are a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The rivalry between the Dodgers and Yankees is one of the most well - known rivalries in Major League Baseball . The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series , more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues . The initial significance was embodied in the two teams ' proximity in New York City , when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn . After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958 , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States , and since the 1980s , the two largest cities in the United States . The Dodgers currently lead the regular season series 7 - 6 . Although the rivalry 's significance arose from the two teams ' numerous World Series meetings , the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981 . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004 , when they played a 3 - game interleague series . Nevertheless , games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds .

During World War I , in an effort to conserve fuel , Germany began observing DST on May 1 , 1916 . The rest of Europe soon followed . The plan was not adopted in the United States until the Standard Time Act of March 19 , 1918 , which confirmed the existing standard time zone system and set summer DST to begin on March 31 , 1918 ( reverting October 27 ) . The idea was unpopular and Congress abolished DST after the war , overriding President Woodrow Wilson 's veto . DST became a local option and was observed in some states until World War II , when President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year - round DST , called `` War Time '' , on February 9 , 1942 . It lasted until the last Sunday ( the 30th ) in September 1945 . After 1945 many states and cities east of the Mississippi River ( and mostly north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers ) adopted summer DST .

The most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the portal tomb -- a chamber consisting of upright stones ( orthostats ) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof . Many of these , though by no means all , contain human remains , but it is debatable whether use as burial sites was their primary function . The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe , in particular Skorba Temples . Though generally known as dolmens , the correct term accepted by archaeologists is portal tomb . However many local names exist , such as anta in Galicia and Portugal , stazzone in Sardinia , hunebed in the Netherlands , Hünengrab in Germany , dysse in Denmark , and cromlech in Wales . It is assumed that most portal tombs were originally covered by earthen mounds .

Disillusioned , Dusty walks off after the concert without telling his manager , Lula ( Lesley Ann Warren ) . The only person he tells is his best friend and drummer , Earl ( John Doe ) , and that he is `` taking a walk , '' but does not say exactly where he is going or for how long . Dusty is singing a blurry version of `` Where the Sidewalk Ends '' . In a down home bar , we see Al ( Mark Walters ) . Dusty had breakfast with the Tucker family during this scene .

In about 1732 , Robin , a youth , arrives by ferry in Boston seeking his kinsman , Major Molineux , an official in the British Colonial government , who has promised him work . Yet no one in town tells him where the major is . A rich man threatens the youth with prison , and an innkeeper calls him a runaway bond - servant . At the inn , he meets a man with a face described as looking like the devil - two protrusions emanating from his forehead ( like horns ) , eyes burning like ' fire in a cave ' - who seems at the center of many evil things . Later , he runs into the man again , but this time his face is painted black and red . After blocking his path with a cudgel , he finally gets the answer that his kinsman will soon pass by . He waits at the spot on the steps of a church where he is greeted by the first polite gentleman he has met all night . Soon , the two men hear the roar of an approaching mob . At its head is the man with the red and black face and in its midst is Major Molineux , tarred and feathered . The crowd is in an uproar , and everyone is laughing . Soon , so is young Robin , as his eyes meet those of the Major , who knows him right away . Disillusioned , the youth asks the gentleman the way back to the ferry . Yet the latter restrains him , saying that it is still possible for him to thrive without his kinsman 's protection .

A camel is an even - toed ungulate in the genus Camelus , bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as `` humps '' on its back . The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary , or one - humped camel ( C. dromedarius ) , which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa ; the Bactrian , or two - humped camel ( C. bactrianus ) , which inhabits Central Asia ; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel ( C. ferus ) that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia . Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia . Additionally one other species of camel in the separate genus Camelops , C. hesternus lived in western North America and became extinct when humans entered the continent at the end of the Pleistocene . Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated ; they provide milk , meat , hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches , and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads .

The ventricles are filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) which bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord within their bony confines . CSF is produced by modified ependymal cells of the choroid plexus found in all components of the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct and the posterior and anterior horns of the lateral ventricles . CSF flows from the lateral ventricles via the interventricular foramina into the third ventricle , and then the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct in the brainstem . From the fourth ventricle it can pass into the central canal of the spinal cord or into the subarachnoid cisterns via three small foramina : the central median aperture and the two lateral apertures .

The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land - living organisms , both alive and dead , as well as carbon stored in soils . About 500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms , while soil holds approximately 1,500 gigatons of carbon . Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon , while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms , such as calcium carbonate . Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth . Autotrophs extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide , converting it into organic carbon , while heterotrophs receive carbon by consuming other organisms .
Principal photography began on October 6 , 1975 in Lake Powell . A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming . Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently .
Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin , but has only small amounts of both . More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry blond color , and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy blond color . Many children born with blond hair develop darker hair as they age , with the majority of natural blonds developing a hair color of a dark blond hue by the time they reach middle age . Pregnancy hormones hasten this process . Natural light blond hair is rare in adulthood , with claims of the world 's population ranging from 2 % naturally blond to 16 % in the US . Blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe . Studies in 2012 showed that naturally blond hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase - related protein 1 ( TYRP1 ) . In the Solomon Islands , 26 % of the population carry the gene ; however , it is absent outside of Oceania .

Although the official Christmas tree tradition at Rockefeller Center began in 1933 ( the year 30 Rockefeller Plaza opened ) , an unofficial tradition began during the Depression - era construction of the Center , when workers decorated a smaller 20 foot ( 6.1 m ) balsam fir with `` strings of cranberries , garlands of paper , and even a few tin cans '' on Christmas Eve ( December 24 , 1931 ) , as recounted by Daniel Okrent in his history of Rockefeller Center . According to Rockefeller Center , workers pooled their money for that unlit tree , with the garlands made by workers ' families .
Many modern scholars suggest that the first potter 's wheel was first developed by the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia . A stone potter 's wheel found at the Sumerian city of Ur in modern - day Iraq has been dated to about 3129 BC , but fragments of wheel - thrown pottery of an even earlier date have been recovered in the same area . However , southeastern Europe and China have also been claimed as possible places of origin . Furthermore , the wheel was also in popular use by potters starting around 3500 BC in major cities of the Indus Valley civilization in South Asia , namely Harappa and Mohenjo - daro ( Kenoyer , 2005 ) . Others consider Egypt as `` being the place of origin of the potter 's wheel . It was here that the turntable shaft was lengthened about 3000 BC and a flywheel added . The flywheel was kicked and later was moved by pulling the edge with the left hand while forming the clay with the right . This led to the counterclockwise motion for the potter 's wheel which is almost universal . '' Hence the exact origin of the wheel is not wholly clear yet .
G is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing . The cell cycle starts with this phase . The word `` post-mitotic '' is sometimes used to refer to both quiescent and senescent cells . Non-proliferative ( non-dividing ) cells in multicellular eukaryotes generally enter the quiescent G state from G and may remain quiescent for long periods of time , possibly indefinitely ( as is often the case for neurons ) . This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated . Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and external stress and usually constitutes an arrest in G. Some cells enter the G phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic , e.g. , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . Many cells do not enter G and continue to divide throughout an organism 's life , e.g. , epithelial cells .

Ibuprofen was derived from propionic acid by the research arm of Boots Group during the 1960s . Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin . It was discovered by a team led by Stewart Adams and the patent application was filed in 1961 . Adams initially tested the drug as treatment for his hangover . The drug was launched as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the United Kingdom in 1969 , and in the United States in 1974 . Later , in 1983 and 1984 , it became the first NSAID ( other than aspirin ) to be available over the counter ( OTC ) in these two countries . Dr. Adams was subsequently awarded an OBE in 1987 . Boots was awarded the Queen 's Award for Technical Achievement for the development of the drug in 1987 .

The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants . Males reached shoulder heights between 2.7 and 3.4 m ( 8.9 and 11.2 ft ) and weighed up to 6 metric tons ( 6.6 short tons ) . Females reached 2.6 -- 2.9 m ( 8.5 -- 9.5 ft ) in shoulder heights and weighed up to 4 metric tons ( 4.4 short tons ) . A newborn calf weighed about 90 kilograms ( 200 lb ) . The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age . It was covered in fur , with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat . The colour of the coat varied from dark to light . The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss . It had long , curved tusks and four molars , which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual . Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants , and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects , fighting , and foraging . The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges . Individuals could probably reach the age of 60 . Its habitat was the mammoth steppe , which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America .

The Dust Bowl exodus was the largest migration in American history within a short period of time . Between 1930 and 1940 , approximately 3.5 million people moved out of the Plains states ; of those , it is unknown how many moved to California . In just over a year , over 86,000 people migrated to California . This number is more than the number of migrants to that area during the 1849 Gold Rush . Migrants abandoned farms in Oklahoma , Arkansas , Missouri , Iowa , Nebraska , Kansas , Texas , Colorado , and New Mexico , but were often generally referred to as `` Okies '' , `` Arkies '' , or `` Texies '' . Terms such as `` Okies '' and `` Arkies '' came to be known in the 1930s as the standard terms for those who had lost everything and were struggling the most during the Great Depression .
After the Allied victory in World War II , Yugoslavia was set up as a federation of six republics , with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines : Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia and Slovenia . In addition , two autonomous provinces were established within Serbia : Vojvodina and Kosovo . Each of the republics had its own branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia party and a ruling elite , and any tensions were solved on the federal level . The Yugoslav model of state organization , as well as a `` middle way '' between planned and liberal economy , had been a relative success , and the country experienced a period of strong economic growth and relative political stability up to the 1980s , under the rule of president - for - life Josip Broz Tito . After his death in 1980 , the weakened system of federal government was left unable to cope with rising economic and political challenges .

Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly , sharing a love of the game : basketball . Quincy ( played as a youth by Glendon Chattman ) is shocked that a girl could ever love basketball as much as he did , and he is even more shocked when Monica plays so well . Although their first interaction results in Quincy angrily knocking her down during game point and accidentally scarring her face , they share their first kiss on the first day of school and end the `` first quarter '' of the story fighting in the grass .

The King and I is a 1956 American musical film made by 20th Century Fox , directed by Walter Lang and produced by Charles Brackett and Darryl F. Zanuck . The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is based on the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical The King and I , based in turn on the novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon . That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by Anna Leonowens , who became school teacher to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s . Leonowens ' stories were autobiographical , although various elements of them have been called into question . The film stars Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner .
Dwight is the only person that Angela likes in the office . It is shown in `` E-mail Surveillance '' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship . Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him , she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship , and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight 's passion for her . Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M. '' : when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses `` how loudly I love you '' , Angela meekly whispers `` It 's too loud . '' In `` Traveling Salesman '' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate , so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them . After Dwight is told he would be fired if he did n't tell Michael why he went to New York , he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela . Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him . After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4 , she stops dating Dwight , but at the end of `` Goodbye Toby '' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight . Dwight ends their affair in `` The Duel '' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy . In `` The Delivery '' Dwight , who wants to improve his sales by having a child , asks Angela to have his baby . The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together , but in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight hooks up with Pam 's friend Isabel , and tells Angela he does n't want her to have his baby . In `` The Chump '' the two call in a lawyer , and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times . She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton . After she gives birth ( Jury Duty ) , Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he , not Robert , is the father .

Itai - itai disease was caused by cadmium poisoning due to mining in Toyama Prefecture . The earliest records of mining for gold in the area date back to 1710 . Regular mining for silver started in 1589 , and soon thereafter , mining for lead , copper , and zinc began . Increased demand for raw materials during the Russo - Japanese War and World War I , as well as new mining technologies from Europe , increased the output of the mines , putting the Kamioka Mines in Toyama among the world 's top mines . Production increased even more before World War II . Starting in 1910 and continuing through 1945 , cadmium was released in significant quantities by mining operations , and the disease first appeared around 1912 . Prior to World War II , the mining , controlled by the Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. , Ltd. , increased to satisfy the wartime demand . This subsequently increased the pollution of the Jinzū River and its tributaries . The river was used mainly for irrigation of rice fields , but also for drinking water , washing , fishing , and other uses by downstream populations .

The series follows a family of six , and later seven , and stars Frankie Muniz in the lead role of Malcolm , a somewhat normal boy who tests at genius level . While he enjoys his intelligence , he despises having to take classes for gifted children , who are mocked by the other students who call them `` Krelboynes '' . Jane Kaczmarek is Malcolm 's overbearing , authoritarian mother , Lois , and Bryan Cranston plays his immature but loving father , Hal . Christopher Kennedy Masterson plays eldest brother Francis , a former rebel who , in earlier episodes , was in military school , but eventually marries and settles into a steady job .

Younger brother Dewey , bitter about his ruined childhood , smart , and musically talented , is portrayed by Erik Per Sullivan . At first , the show 's focus was on Malcolm , but as the series progressed , it began to explore all six members of the family . A fifth son , Jamie , was introduced as a baby at the end of Season 4 .
However , opinion was divided , with support for co-operation coming from some members of the Muslim League and also both Hindus and members of the Central Sikh League . An All - India Committee for Cooperation with the Simon Commission was established by the Council of India and by selection of the Viceroy , Lord Irwin . The members of the committee were : C. Sankaran Nair ( Chairman ) , Arthur Froom , Nawab Ali Khan , Shivdev Singh Uberoi , Zulfiqar Ali Khan , Hari Singh Gour , Abdullah Al - Mamun Suhrawardy , Kikabhai Premchand and M.C. Rajah .

On December 8 , 1941 , the United States Congress declared war ( Public Law 77 - 328 , 55 STAT 795 ) on the Empire of Japan in response to that country 's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor the prior day . It was formulated an hour after the Infamy Speech of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Japan had sent a message for the United States to its embassy in Washington earlier , but because of problems at the embassy in decoding the very long message -- the high security level assigned to the declaration meant that only personnel with very high clearances could decode it , which slowed down the process -- it was not delivered to the U.S. Secretary of State until after the Pearl Harbor attack . Following the U.S. declaration , Japan 's allies , Germany and Italy , declared war on the United States , bringing the United States fully into World War II .

Spinal fusion , also called spondylodesis or spondylosyndesis , is a neurosurgical or orthopedic surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae . This procedure can be performed at any level in the spine ( cervical , thoracic , or lumbar ) and prevents any movement between the fused vertebrae . There are many types of spinal fusion and each technique involves using bone grafting - either from the patient ( autograft ) , donor ( allograft ) , or artificial bone substitutes - to help the bones heal together . Additional hardware ( screws , plates , or cages ) is often used to hold the bones in place while the graft fuses the two vertebrae together .

The Fall of the Western Roman Empire ( also called Fall of the Roman Empire or Fall of Rome ) was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule , and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities . The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control ; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army , the health and numbers of the Roman population , the strength of the economy , the competence of the Emperor , the religious changes of the period , and the efficiency of the civil administration . Increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse . The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure .
Producer Norman Whitfield recorded `` I Heard It Through the Grapevine '' with various Motown artists . The first known recording is with the Miracles on August 6 , 1966 , though there may also have been a recording with the Isley Brothers , or at least Whitfield intended to record it with them ; however a track has not turned up -- some Motown historians believe that a session may have been scheduled but cancelled . The Miracles ' version was not released as a single due to Berry Gordy 's veto during Motown 's weekly quality control meetings ; Gordy advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single . The Miracles version later appeared on their 1968 Special Occasion album , and a slightly different take , possibly from the same session but unreleased , appeared on the 1998 compilation album , Motown Sings Motown Treasures .

In these cases , peacekeepers remain members of their respective armed forces , and do not constitute an independent `` UN army , '' as the UN does not have such a force . In cases where direct UN involvement is not considered appropriate or feasible , the Council authorizes regional organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the Economic Community of West African States , or coalitions of willing countries to undertake peacekeeping or peace - enforcement tasks .

Zeus gets a sound beating , once even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout , but survives the final round and wins the match by the judges ' decision .

The final draft of the Declaration was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 , although the date of its signing has long been disputed . Most historians have concluded that it was signed on August 2 , 1776 , nearly a month after its adoption , and not on July 4 as is commonly believed .
Armed conflict began in 1775 . In 1776 , the Second Continental Congress declared a new , independent nation : the United States of America . Led by General George Washington , it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France . The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Canada and Florida ) . The Articles of Confederation established a central government , but it was ineffectual at providing stability , as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer . A convention in 1787 wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789 . In 1791 , a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights . With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser , a strong central government was created . Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States . A second and final war with Britain was fought in 1812 , which solidified national pride .

The Comanche / kəˈmæntʃiː / ( Comanche : Nʉmʉnʉʉ ) are a Native American nation from the Great Plains whose historic territory , known as Comancheria , consisted of present - day eastern New Mexico , southeastern Colorado , southwestern Kansas , western Oklahoma , and most of northwest Texas and northern Chihuahua . The Comanche people are federally recognized as the Comanche Nation , headquartered in Lawton , Oklahoma .
Other than the few bulls needed for breeding , the vast majority of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years , except where they are needed ( castrated ) as work oxen for haulage . Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating , although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef . A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female , and produces proportionately more , leaner muscle .
The Duanwu Festival , also often known , especially in the West , as the Dragon Boat Festival , is a traditional holiday originating in China , occurring near the summer solstice . It is also known as Zhongxiao Festival ( Chinese : 忠孝 節 ; pinyin : Zhōngxiàojié ) , commemorating fealty and filial piety . The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional Chinese calendar , which is the source of the festival 's alternative name , the Double Fifth Festival . The Chinese calendar is lunisolar , so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the Gregorian calendar . In 2016 , it occurred on June 9 ; and in 2017 , on May 30 .
Athens emerged as the dominant economic power in Greece around the late 6th century BCE , this was further bolstered by the finding of several veins of silver in the neighbouring mountains which further added to their wealth . They facilitated an efficient trading system with other Greek city states . Again , pots and other forms of cooking utensils seem to have been the most quantitatively traded product ( over 80,000 amphorae and other such things have been recovered from around Athens in archaeological digs ) . Marble and bronze artwork also seems to have been traded ( though it was largely a luxury product , and this trade only really exploded after the rise of the Roman Republic , as Greek Art exerted a massive influence on Roman Culture on all levels ) . Athens began to import grain due to poor soil conditions however .

Rumors of the secret show had started the night before , and fans were starting to gather outside the old Tower Records building at Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood .

A common procedure is that after the cards have been shuffled , the dealer sets the cards face - down on the table near the player designated to make the cut , typically the player to the dealer 's right . That player initiates a cut of the deck by taking a contiguous range of cards off the top of the deck and placing it face - down on the table closer to the dealer ; the dealer completes the cut by taking the original bottom portion of the deck and placing it on top of the just - moved cards . Once the cut is complete , the dealer picks up the deck , straightens or `` squares '' it , and deals the cards .

Since medication to prevent rejection is so effective , donors do not need to be similar to their recipient . Most donated kidneys come from deceased donors ; however , the utilisation of living donors in the United States is on the rise . In 2006 , 47 % of donated kidneys were from living donors . This varies by country : for example , only 3 % of kidneys transplanted during 2006 in Spain came from living donors . In Spain all citizens are potential organ donors in the case of their death , unless they explicitly opt out during their lifetime .

Filming began on May 21 , 1967 , and ended on August 10 , 1967 . Most of the early scenes of a desert - like terrain were shot in northern Arizona near the Grand Canyon , the Colorado River , Lake Powell , Glen Canyon and other locations near Page , Arizona Most scenes of the ape village , interiors and exteriors , were filmed on the Fox Ranch in Malibu Creek State Park , northwest of Los Angeles , essentially the backlot of 20th Century Fox . The concluding beach scenes were filmed on a stretch of California seacoast between Malibu and Oxnard with cliffs that towered 130 feet above the shore . Reaching the beach on foot was virtually impossible , so cast , crew , film equipment , and even horses had to be lowered in by helicopter . The home movies of Roddy McDowall ( on YouTube ) show makeup , the Ape Village set and the beach site / set - a wooden ramp was built around the point from Westward Beach to Pirates Cove for access to the beach set . The remains of the Statue of Liberty were shot in a secluded cove on the far eastern end of Westward Beach , between Zuma Beach and Point Dume in Malibu . As noted in the documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes , the special effect shot of the half - buried statue was achieved by seamlessly blending a matte painting with existing cliffs . The shot looking down at Taylor was done from a 70 - foot scaffold , angled over a 1 / 2 - scale papier - mache model of the Statue . The actors in Planet of the Apes were so affected by their roles and wardrobe that , when not shooting , they automatically segregated themselves with the species they were portraying .

In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory , explained in detail in Darwin 's On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) . Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics . During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields , resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology -- the modern synthesis .
The book is set at the end of the nineteenth century . The protagonist is a 14 - year - old boy named Jay Berry Lee , who had enjoyed an idyllic childhood . Born to Missouri sharecroppers , he moves with his family to Oklahoma after his grandfather offers them free land . Daisy , his sister , has a crippled leg , and they devote much effort to gaining enough money to pay for reconstructive surgery . One day , while looking for their lost milk cow , Jay Berry discovers monkeys in a nearby river bottom . Visiting his grandfather 's store , he learns that they have escaped from a travelling circus , which has offered a vast reward for their capture : $100 for the chief monkey , `` Jimbo '' , and $2 each for the others . Jay Berry makes multiple attempts to capture them using traps and a net borrowed from his grandfather , but he gains only scratches and bites from them , at one point even losing his pants in the process .

`` What Child Is This ? '' is a Christmas carol whose lyrics were written by William Chatterton Dix , in 1865 . At the time of composing the carol , Dix worked as an insurance company manager and had been struck by a severe illness . While recovering , he underwent a spiritual renewal that led him to write several hymns , including lyrics to this carol that was subsequently set to the tune of `` Greensleeves '' , a traditional English folk song . Although it was written in Great Britain , the carol is more popular in the United States than in its country of origin today .

The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west - southwest of Washington , D.C. It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces .
After crossing Cuba near Menelao Mora , Hurricane Charley accelerated to the north - northeast , toward the southwest coast of Florida in response to the approach of an unseasonal mid-tropospheric trough . Charley passed over the Dry Tortugas at 1200 UTC on August 13 , with maximum winds of about 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . The strike occurred only 22 hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall on St. Vincent Island , marking the first time two tropical cyclones hit the same state within a 24 - hour period . Then Charley rapidly intensified , strengthening from a 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) hurricane with a minimum central barometric pressure of 965 mbar ( hPa ; 28.50 inHg ) to a 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) hurricane with a pressure of 947 mbar ( hPa ; 27.96 inHg ) in just three hours . It continued to strengthen as it turned more to the northeast , and made landfall near the island of Cayo Costa , Florida as a 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) Category 4 hurricane with a pressure of 941 mbar ( hPa ; 27.79 inHg ) at approximately 1945 UTC on August 13 . An hour later , the hurricane struck Punta Gorda as a 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) storm and then passed up through Port Charlotte . However , the eye had shrunk before landfall , limiting the most powerful winds to an area within 7 mi ( 11 km ) of the center .
In biology , cell theory is the historic scientific theory , now universally accepted , that living organisms are made up of cells . Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction . With continual improvements made to microscopes over time , magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century . This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann . However , many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory .

The oil and gas industry is usually divided into three major sectors : upstream ( or exploration and production - E&P ) , midstream and downstream . The upstream sector includes searching for potential underground or underwater crude oil and natural gas fields , drilling exploratory wells , and subsequently drilling and operating the wells that recover and bring the crude oil or raw natural gas to the surface . There has been a significant shift toward including unconventional gas as a part of the upstream sector , and corresponding developments in liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) processing and transport .

The Spanish Civil War ( Spanish : Guerra Civil Española ) , widely known in Spain simply as The Civil War ( Spanish : La Guerra Civil ) or The War ( Spanish : La Guerra ) , took place from 1936 to 1939 . The Republicans , who were loyal to the democratic , left - leaning and relatively urban Second Spanish Republic , in an alliance of convenience with the Anarchists and Communists , fought against the Nationalists , a Falangist , Carlist , Catholic , and largely aristocratic conservative group led by General Francisco Franco . The war has often been portrayed as a struggle between democracy and fascism , particularly due to the political climate and timing surrounding it , but it can more accurately be described as a struggle between leftist revolution and rightist counter-revolution similar to the Finnish Civil War , the Russian Civil War , and the wars fought over the formation of the Hungarian and Slovak Soviet republics . In early 1939 , the Nationalists won , and Franco ruled over all of Spain until his death in November 1975 .

Wallace is a Scottish surname derived from the Anglo - Norman French waleis , which is in turn derived from a cognate of the Old English wylisc ( pronounced `` wullish '' ) meaning `` foreigner '' or `` Welshman '' ( etymology ; see also Wallach and Walhaz ) . The original surname may have denoted someone from the former Kingdom of Strathclyde who spoke Cumbric , a close relative of the Welsh language , or possibly an incomer from Wales , or the Welsh Marches . The Kingdom of Strathclyde was originally a part of the Hen Ogledd , its people speaking a Brythonic language distinct from Scottish Gaelic and the English derived from Lothian . In modern times , in the 19th and 20th centuries , the surname has been used as an Americanization of numerous Ashkenazic Jewish surnames .
